## Module React.Basic

#### `ComponentSpec`

``` purescript
type ComponentSpec props state action = (initialState :: state, update :: Self props state action -> action -> StateUpdate props state action, render :: Self props state action -> JSX, shouldUpdate :: Self props state action -> props -> state -> Boolean, didMount :: Self props state action -> Effect Unit, didUpdate :: Self props state action -> Effect Unit, willUnmount :: Self props state action -> Effect Unit)
```

`ComponentSpec` represents a React-Basic component implementation.

These are the properties your component definition may override
with specific implementations. None are required to be overridden, unless
an overridden function interacts with `state`, in which case `initialState`
is required (the compiler enforces this). While you _can_ use `state` and
dispatch actions without defining `update`, doing so doesn't make much sense
and will emit a warning.

- `initialState`
  - The component's starting state.
  - Avoid mirroring prop values in state.
- `update`
  - All state updates go through `update`.
  - `update` is called when `send` is used to dispatch an action.
  - State changes are described using `StateUpdate`. Only `Update` and `UpdateAndSideEffects` will cause rerenders and a call to `didUpdate`.
  - Side effects requested are only invoked _after_ any corrosponding state update has completed its render cycle and the changes have been applied. This means it is safe to interact with the DOM in a side effect, for example.
- `render`
  - Takes a current snapshot of the component (`Self`) and converts it to renderable `JSX`.
- `shouldUpdate`
  - Can be useful for performance optimizations. Rarely necessary.
- `didMount`
  - The React component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle. Useful for initiating an action on first mount, such as fetching data from a server.
- `didUpdate`
  - The React component's `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle. Rarely necessary.
- `willUnmount`
  - The React component's `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle. Any subscriptions or timers created in `didMount` or `didUpdate` should be disposed of here.

The component spec is generally not exported from your component
module and this type is rarely used explicitly. `make` will validate whether
your component's internal types line up.

For example:

```purs
component :: Component Props
component = createComponent "Counter"

type Props =
  { label :: String
  }

data Action
  = Increment

counter :: Props -> JSX
counter: make component
  { initialState = { counter: 0 }

  , update: \self action -> case action of
      Increment ->
        Update self.state { counter = self.state.counter + 1 }

  , render: \self ->
      R.button
        { onClick: capture_ self Increment
        , children: [ R.text (self.props.label <> ": " <> show self.state.counter) ]
        }
  }
```

This example component overrides `initialState`, `update`, and `render`.

__*Note:* A `ComponentSpec` is *not* a valid React component by itself. If you would like to use
  a React-Basic component from JavaScript, use `toReactComponent`.__

__*See also:* `Component`, `ComponentSpec`, `make`, `makeStateless`__

#### `createComponent`

``` purescript
createComponent :: forall props. String -> Component props
```

Creates a `Component` with a given Display Name.

The resulting component spec is usually given the simplified `Component` type:

```purs
component :: Component Props
component = createComponent "Counter"
```

This function should be used at the module level and considered side effecting.
This is because React uses referential equality when deciding whether a new
`JSX` tree is a valid update or if it needs to be replaced entirely
(expensive and clears component state lower in the tree).

__*Note:* A specific type for the props in `Component props` should always be chosen at this point.
  It's technically possible to declare the component with `forall props. Component props`
  but doing so is unsafe. Leaving the prop type open allows the use of a single `Component`
  definition in multiple React-Basic components that may have different prop types. Because
  component lifecycles are managed by React, it becomes possible for incompatible prop values to
  be passed by React into lifecycle functions.__

__*Note:* A `Component` is *not* a valid React component by itself. If you would like to use
  a React-Basic component from JavaScript, use `toReactComponent`.__

__*See also:* `Component`, `make`, `makeStateless`__

#### `Component`

``` purescript
data Component props
```

A simplified alias for `ComponentSpec`. This type is usually used to represent
the default component type returned from `createComponent`.
Opaque component information for internal use.

__*Note:* Never define a component with
  a less specific type for `props` than its associated `ComponentSpec` and `make`
  calls, as this can lead to unsafe interactions with React's lifecycle management.__

__*For the curious:* This is the "class" React will use to render and
  identify the component. It receives the `ComponentSpec` as a prop and knows
  how to defer behavior to it. It requires very specific props and is not useful by
  itself from JavaScript. For JavaScript interop, see `toReactComponent`.__

#### `StateUpdate`

``` purescript
data StateUpdate props state action
  = NoUpdate
  | Update state
  | SideEffects (Self props state action -> Effect Unit)
  | UpdateAndSideEffects state (Self props state action -> Effect Unit)
```

Used by the `update` function to describe the kind of state update and/or side
effects desired.

__*See also:* `ComponentSpec`, `capture`__

#### `Self`

``` purescript
type Self props state action = { props :: props, state :: state, instance_ :: ReactComponentInstance }
```

`Self` represents the component instance at a particular point in time.

- `props`
  - A snapshot of `props` taken when this `Self` was created.
- `state`
  - A snapshot of `state` taken when this `Self` was created.
- `instance_`
  - Unsafe escape hatch to the underlying component instance (`this` in the JavaScript React paradigm). Avoid as much as possible, but it's still frequently better than rewriting an entire component in JavaScript.

__*See also:* `ComponentSpec`, `send`, `capture`, `readProps`, `readState`__

#### `send`

``` purescript
send :: forall props state action. Self props state action -> action -> Effect Unit
```

Dispatch an `action` into the component to be handled by `update`.

__*See also:* `update`, `capture`__

#### `sendAsync`

``` purescript
sendAsync :: forall props state action. Self props state action -> Aff action -> Effect Unit
```

Convenience function for sending an action when an `Aff` completes.

__*Note:* Potential failure should be handled in the given `Aff` and converted
  to an action, as the default error handler will simply log the   error to
  the console.__

__*See also:* `send`__

#### `capture`

``` purescript
capture :: forall props state action a. Self props state action -> EventFn SyntheticEvent a -> (a -> action) -> EventHandler
```

Create a capturing\* `EventHandler` to send an action when an event occurs. For
more complicated event handlers requiring `Effect`, use `handler` from `React.Basic.Events`.

__\*calls `preventDefault` and `stopPropagation`__

__*See also:* `update`, `capture_`, `monitor`, `React.Basic.Events`__

#### `capture_`

``` purescript
capture_ :: forall props state action. Self props state action -> action -> EventHandler
```

Like `capture`, but for actions which don't need to extract information from the Event.

__*See also:* `update`, `capture`, `monitor_`__

#### `monitor`

``` purescript
monitor :: forall props state action a. Self props state action -> EventFn SyntheticEvent a -> (a -> action) -> EventHandler
```

Like `capture`, but does not cancel the event.

__*See also:* `update`, `capture`, `monitor\_`__

#### `monitor_`

``` purescript
monitor_ :: forall props state action. Self props state action -> action -> EventHandler
```

Like `capture_`, but does not cancel the event.

__*See also:* `update`, `monitor`, `capture_`, `React.Basic.Events`__

#### `readProps`

``` purescript
readProps :: forall props state action. Self props state action -> Effect props
```

Read the most up to date `props` directly from the component instance
associated with this `Self`.

_Note: This function is for specific, asynchronous edge cases.
  Generally, the `props` snapshot on `Self` is sufficient.

__*See also:* `Self`__

#### `readState`

``` purescript
readState :: forall props state action. Self props state action -> Effect state
```

Read the most up to date `state` directly from the component instance
associated with this `Self`.

_Note: This function is for specific, asynchronous edge cases.
  Generally, the `state` snapshot on `Self` is sufficient.

__*See also:* `Self`__

#### `make`

``` purescript
make :: forall spec spec_ props state action. Union spec spec_ (ComponentSpec props state action) => Component props -> { render :: Self props state action -> JSX | spec } -> props -> JSX
```

Turn a `Component` and `ComponentSpec` into a usable render function.
This is where you will want to provide customized implementations:

```purs
component :: Component Props
component = createComponent "Counter"

type Props =
  { label :: String
  }

data Action
  = Increment

counter :: Props -> JSX
counter = make component
  { initialState: { counter: 0 }

  , update: \self action -> case action of
      Increment ->
        Update self.state { counter = self.state.counter + 1 }

  , render: \self ->
      R.button
        { onClick: capture_ self Increment
        , children: [ R.text (self.props.label <> ": " <> show self.state.counter) ]
        }
  }
```

__*See also:* `makeStateless`, `createComponent`, `Component`, `ComponentSpec`__

#### `makeStateless`

``` purescript
makeStateless :: forall props. Component props -> (props -> JSX) -> props -> JSX
```

Makes stateless component definition slightly less verbose:

```purs
component :: Component Props
component = createComponent "Xyz"

myComponent :: Props -> JSX
myComponent = makeStateless component \props -> JSX
```

__*Note:* The only difference between a stateless React-Basic component and
  a plain `props -> JSX` function is the presense of the component name
  in React's dev tools and error stacks. It's just a conceptual boundary.
  If this isn't important simply write a `props -> JSX` function.__

__*See also:* `make`, `createComponent`, `Component`, `ComponentSpec`__

#### `JSX`

``` purescript
data JSX :: Type
```

Represents rendered React VDOM (the result of calling `React.createElement`
in JavaScript).

`JSX` is a `Monoid`:

- `append`
  - Merge two `JSX` nodes using `React.Fragment`.
- `mempty`
  - The `empty` node; renders nothing.

__*Hint:* Many useful utility functions already exist for Monoids. For example,
  `guard` can be used to conditionally render a subtree of components.__

##### Instances
``` purescript
Semigroup JSX
Monoid JSX
```

#### `empty`

``` purescript
empty :: JSX
```

An empty `JSX` node. This is often useful when you would like to conditionally
show something, but you don't want to (or can't) modify the `children` prop
on the parent node.

__*See also:* `JSX`, Monoid `guard`__

#### `keyed`

``` purescript
keyed :: String -> JSX -> JSX
```

Apply a React key to a subtree. React-Basic usually hides React's warning about
using `key` props on components in an Array, but keys are still important for
any dynamic lists of child components.

__*See also:* React's documentation regarding the special `key` prop__

#### `fragment`

``` purescript
fragment :: Array JSX -> JSX
```

Render an Array of children without a wrapping component.

__*See also:* `JSX`__

#### `element`

``` purescript
element :: forall props. ReactComponent {  | props } -> {  | props } -> JSX
```

Create a `JSX` node from a `ReactComponent`, by providing the props.

This function is for non-React-Basic React components, such as those
imported from FFI.

__*See also:* `ReactComponent`, `elementKeyed`__

#### `elementKeyed`

``` purescript
elementKeyed :: forall props. ReactComponent {  | props } -> { key :: String | props } -> JSX
```

Create a `JSX` node from a `ReactComponent`, by providing the props and a key.

This function is for non-React-Basic React components, such as those
imported from FFI.

__*See also:* `ReactComponent`, `element`, React's documentation regarding the special `key` prop__

#### `displayNameFromComponent`

``` purescript
displayNameFromComponent :: forall props. Component props -> String
```

Retrieve the Display Name from a `ComponentSpec`. Useful for debugging and improving
error messages in logs.

__*See also:* `displayNameFromSelf`, `createComponent`__

#### `displayNameFromSelf`

``` purescript
displayNameFromSelf :: forall props state action. Self props state action -> String
```

Retrieve the Display Name from a `Self`. Useful for debugging and improving
error messages in logs.

__*See also:* `displayNameFromComponent`, `createComponent`__

#### `ReactComponent`

``` purescript
data ReactComponent props
```

Represents a traditional React component. Useful for JavaScript interop and
FFI. For example:

```purs
foreign import ComponentRequiringJSHacks :: ReactComponent { someProp :: String }
```

__*See also:* `element`, `toReactComponent`__

#### `ReactComponentInstance`

``` purescript
data ReactComponentInstance
```

An opaque representation of a React component's instance (`this` in the JavaScript
React paradigm). It exists as an escape hatch to unsafe behavior. Use it with
caution.

#### `toReactComponent`

``` purescript
toReactComponent :: forall spec spec_ jsProps props state action. Union spec spec_ (ComponentSpec props state action) => ({  | jsProps } -> props) -> Component props -> { render :: Self props state action -> JSX | spec } -> ReactComponent {  | jsProps }
```

Convert a React-Basic `ComponentSpec` to a JavaScript-friendly React component.
This function should only be used for JS interop and not normal React-Basic usage.

__*Note:* Like `createComponent`, `toReactComponent` is side effecting in that
  it creates a "class" React will see as unique each time it's called. Lift
  any usage up to the module level, usage in `render` or any other function,
  and applying any type classes to the `props`.__
